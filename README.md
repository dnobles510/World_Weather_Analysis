# World_Weather_Analysis
# Overview
The overview of this project is to create a weather database that people could use to help them pick their next vacation location

# Results
I created a weather data base in the Weather_Database folder that used latitude and longitudes to assess the realtive nature of the weather in any area.
I then created a code that would allow users to pick a minimum and maximum weather temperature that they would like to stay within.
Once the user selects their weather temperatures, the search would narrow down the cities to the ones that fit within those temperatures.
In the Vacation_Search folder, the criteria included cities, hotels, weather description, temperature,etc. Along with a weather map that would show the users their results based on what temperatures they chose. This map included markers so it was easy to pick a city they would like to visit.
In the Vacation_Itinerary folder I created an example of an excursion to show users that they could use this system to choose multiple cities they could visit during one vacation

# Summary
The Summary of this project is that you can use these types of programs to create a fun and exciting trip and you can even make it into an excursion by picking multiple cities in the same country to visit.
